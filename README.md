This project showcases a simple implementation of expanding cards using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The expanding cards reveal additional content or images when clicked.

Project Structure
The project structure is kept minimal for simplicity:

index.html: Contains the HTML structure for the expanding cards.
style.css: Defines the styling for the HTML elements.
script.js: Implements the JavaScript logic for expanding and collapsing the cards.


Customization
Feel free to customize the content and styling according to your needs. You can modify the HTML in index.html and adjust the styles in style.css.

Demo
You can see a live demo of the expanding cards on GitHub Pages.
